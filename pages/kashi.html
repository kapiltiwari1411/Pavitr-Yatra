                  <p class="sm:w-3/5 leading-relaxed text-base sm:pl-10 pl-0">
<li>India is quite a strict country on dress code anyway and showing too much flesh can bring some unwanted attention, especially if you’re pins are pale as a ghost-like me </li>
<li> There seem to be a ton more bulls here in Varanasi than anywhere else in India.

    As Varanasi was founded by Lord Shiva and bulls are meant to be the living embodiment of Shiva, it does make sense.
    
    But, it can be quite scary to move around a massive bull in the teeny tiny little alleyways. 
</li>
<li> Hinduism originated here, but it’s not just Hindu. Varanasi takes its identity from the great Hindu epics, but like every other city in India, it hosts many religions. Muslims, Hindus, a handful of Jews, and Japanese Buddhists all cohabit. There is occasional strife, but the city is symbolic of the country’s diversity, cramped into one space. Most Hindus are employed by the temples or associated firms, and the Islamic population includes some of the oldest weavers in the country. The Banarasi sari, known for its intricate weaves and borders made with zari—woven threadwork done with threads made of gold—is a coveted specialty</li>

 <li> Varanasi eats dessert for breakfast. And lunch. And dinner. And cream with everything. If you’ve ever dreamed about fried rice balls dipped in saturated, spiced cream (what they call malaiyo), this is the city for you. Lassi, a yoghurt drink popular the world over, is served sweet, with even sweeter accompaniments called rabdi (flour and sugar) fried in a pan. Banarasi (the term for a trend, person or thing belonging to Varanasi) sweet shops are famous all over India. Little shops line little streets with sweets of all shapes and sizes. And there are free samples.</li>
