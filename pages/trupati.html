              <p class="sm:w-3/5 leading-relaxed text-base sm:pl-10 pl-0">Situated in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, Tirupati is known for Lord Venkateshwara Temple, one of the most visited pilgrimage centers in the world. It is also one of the world's richest temples known by different names - Tirumala Temple, Tirupati Temple, and Tirupati Balaji Temple. Tirumala is one of the seven hills in Tirupati, where the main temple is located. The temple is believed to be where Lord Venkateshwara took the form of an idol and is home to the deity Govinda. Tirupati is one of India's oldest cities and is mentioned in many ancient Vedas and Puranas.

                Tirupati is the main town, while Tirumala Hills is where Tirupati Balaji Temple is situated. Also called Sri Venkateshvara Swami Vaari Temple, it is dedicated to Lord Venkateswara, believed to be a form of Lord Vishnu, who appeared on earth to save mankind from kali yuga. The famous Tirupati Laddoo, given as a prasad at the temple, has the Geographical indication tag, which means it can only be made and sold at the temple. It is hugely loved by the pilgrims and is generally included in the paid darshan tickets or can be bought from the laddoo counters inside the temple complex. Many devotees also tonsure their heads as an offering to Lord Venkateswara Swamy once their wish is fulfilled or to get rid of their sins and ego. It is done free of cost at Kalyanakatta buildings. Another popular ritual at Tirupati Temple is Thulabaram, wherein a devotee sits on one side of the weighing balance scale. In contrast, the other side is filled with materials (like sugar, jaggery, tulsi leaves, banana, gold, and coins) more than the weight of the devotee. This ritual is mostly performed with children and infants.
